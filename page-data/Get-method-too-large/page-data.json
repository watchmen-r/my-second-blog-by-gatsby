Not to forget it, note this with other articles.</p>\n<h1>The occurrence</h1>\n<p>When retrieving data from String boot project by another spring boot project. I met the occurrence suddernly. At first I suspect the long URL has long query parameter affects it. Looks like each browser has their own constraints about the lenght of an URL.<br>\nThis is a interesting article about that.\n<a href=\"https://qiita.com/nwtgck/items/e83473dc63386d2da3e5\">https://qiita.com/nwtgck/items/e83473dc63386d2da3e5</a></p>\n<p>As for the Spring boot, there is a constraints of HTTP header and the long length of URL related to it.</p>\n<h1>Solution</h1>\n<p>Some articles said when use GET method when retrieving data with long query parameters, we should avoid using GET method and use POST method instead.</p>\n<p>But I want to comply the practice of API design. And I found the solution to continue using GET method with long query parameters in Spring Boot.</p>\n<p>In property file of Spring boot, we set 'server.max-http-header-size' with enough long length. Actually this default value is '8192'</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"property\"><pre class=\"language-property\"><code class=\"language-property\">// set 64kb\nserver.max-http-header-size=65536</code></pre></div>\n<p>These ones are useful articles.\n<a href=\"https://thewebspark.com/2017/12/06/tomcat-request-header-too-large-resolved/\">https://thewebspark.com/2017/12/06/tomcat-request-header-too-large-resolved/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-max-http-header-size\">https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-max-http-header-size</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Met header is too large when using GET method with the long parameter.","date":"November 21, 2023","description":"Unfortunately, there is a few valuable info for new Java in Japanese.
