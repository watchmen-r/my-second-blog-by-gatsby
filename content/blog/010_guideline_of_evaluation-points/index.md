# Memo on Evaluation Points
I read this book during Golden Week, and it was incredibly educational in helping me understand managerial work.  
[マネジャーの全仕事](https://d21.co.jp/book/detail/978-4-7993-2995-5)

It includes a section on how to evaluate team members, and one part in particular (p. 266) gave me valuable insight. Here are the key evaluation points mentioned:  
1. Workload or level of work
2. Work quality
3. Accuracy
4. Proactiveness and initiative
5. Attitude
6. Learning ability
7. Ability to be a team player
8. Attendance

The book explains that these points are helpful when filling out evaluation sheets. However, I believe being mindful of them in our day-to-day work can also improve the quality of our output and strengthen collaboration with our coworkers.

## How to Apply These Points
We should pay attention to these aspects in our daily work. While they may seem like common sense, it’s not always easy for everyone to consistently follow them. By keeping these points in mind, we can continue growing as professionals and as a team.
